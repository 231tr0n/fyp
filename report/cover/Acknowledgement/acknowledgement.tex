	We sincerely thank our university for introducing and keeping us updated about the advancements in the field of AI and in the form of a very perfectly designed course where we learn the basics and advanced applications of the systems and models in real life. We would like to extend our hearty gratitude and thank our project guide, Dr. Geetha M who has constantly supported us at all times. This course and project wouldnâ€™t have been possible without her constant guidance and support.
